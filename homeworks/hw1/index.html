            Hi Everyone, I am Sukhpal Ghotra, a junior majoring in Mechanical Engineering. 
            I love picking up new skills and learning new things. I am a pretty active guy that also 
            is heavily involved in sports and fitness. I look forward to what this class has to teach and
            am very excited to further my knowledge.

        <h3> Part 2: Reading Response </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> There is a lot of small details that create a good app/website. What color some items are,
                how they are oriented and in what order they show up all matter.</li>
            <li> I liked how they had an example that the analyzed to back up their original claims. For example their observations
                on spotify's thought process when keeping user engagement opened up a whole seperate box of choices when designing apps. 
                Definitely left me with a lot to consider </li>
