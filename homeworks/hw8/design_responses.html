						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I like how this article disccussed how websites are designed to take advantage of Dark Patterns, a sort of psychological phenomenon that 
							makes users make choices that they didn't intend to. A few examples of this include Bait and Switch, Disguised Ads, Friend Spam and Hidden Costs that can all be found in different forms on websites, hidden under a different 
							type of form on the webpage. It was definetly interesting to see the various unethical ways that dark patterns are used by designers to take advantage of the customer, and it definetly feels like a scam is occuring even though it is completely 
							legal. I knew stuff like this existed on website as the internet can be a very scary place to traverse if you don't know how to navigate the many pitfalls that show up, but reading this article highlighted a few patterns that even I hadn't heard of.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Overall this article was great in showing multiple examples and highlighting the unethical use of such examples. My favorite part of this article was how at the end the author analyzed the growth of these Dark Patterns rather than a reduction in them over the past.
							This was especially outlined in the 2016 US Election which truly showed how social media and websites can affect large populations through the spread of misinformation. This misinformation gains a platform to spread through the use of Dark Patterns to force people to click on certain news highlights
							which then lead to an endless pit of fake news and rabit hole that abuses the power of dark patterns. This truly highlights the unethical ways of user engagement but also shows why it can be so profitable when used correctly and often. </p>

						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
