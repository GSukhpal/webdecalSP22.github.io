							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article is a good way to end of the semester with a balanced portrayel of what we look for in UX design. I was especially interested in UX design based off of spacial attention vs feature-based attention, both concepts being necessary to consider when aiming to design a website.
								Because humans can only process soo much information at a time feature based attention is especially useful as it constrains the attention of the user to specific functions of the website allowing for the ideas that you want to be shared to be transferred efficiently. It is especially important in this type of 
								design to make sure that not too much other information is present on the website as to not distract the user on too many features. On the other hand Divided Attention has its own use cases especially on websites focused on giving as much information as possible through as little of a time. It was good to read about such use cases
								for attention in design and the many ways to apply attention for your benefit. This has definetly changed how I view websites and their functionality for the user.   </p>

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> 8, good article to end of the semester. Everything that we learned throughout the semester was application design based on human psychology, and it was a nice way to see the most important part of this psychology, attention being identified for its use cases.</p>
