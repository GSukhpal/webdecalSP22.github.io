                            <p> The various ways that a UI can be presented. The aritisitic length to which UI's can be taken to. User experience also needs to be kept in mind rather than making everything flashy. </p>

                            <p> The wide variety of apps and designs that were shown in the article. Literally every field had a part showcasing a UI that could work for it and all of them were exceptional. It was like looking through an art gallary but a gallery made through code. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The add to cart interaction was my favorite. I liked how it changed the shoe size as well as the design when an option was picked. While it could have just shown a very normal transition to the new selected option it was very artisitic and smooth making for a clean user experience. I also liked 
                                the size selector being a scrollable feature as it allowed for more intericate size selection rather than just clicking on speciific buttons. Very good overall, pretty. </p>
