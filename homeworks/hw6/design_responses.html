							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Speed matters for animation, optimal being beween 200-500 ms, ideally 300ms is normal. While speed matters so does the size of the animation, bigger animations usually need to have
								faster animations than smaller objects to make up for their large sizes. In addition if an animation is more complex with alot of moving parts it is shown that it is better for it to last longer.
								Interesting topic was collision and ease time, and how it looks to the human eye. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how long they spent on the Ease-in-out curves to better visualize each cureve and its imapact. In addition everything they stated was backed by some research to correlate that idea.
								For example to get a more natural and realistic feel to any animation that is being utilized it is better to use a more assymetric curve, as in life not everything is strongly coordinated in its movement.
								Final point I thought that was interesting was the emphasis on how objects emergence should be alot more emphasized compared to it leaving as that draws more attention to the animation.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals." </p>
						</li>
