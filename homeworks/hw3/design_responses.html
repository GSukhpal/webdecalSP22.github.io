					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> How to pick a font and design for the website being created. Rather than always trying to reinvent the wheel and going with new avenues everytime,
								look at other peoples work for inspiration. Learn from them but don't plagerise, use online resources, mainly research to pick your fonts and design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> As is with the other articles in class, I love that the articles always back up their claims with a variety of evidence and usefull websites. My favorite part was when
								they detailed how to choose a specific font. They kept it short and sweet by highlighting the three main purposes to be looked at for font usage, readability, legibility and 
								purpose. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Empathize with your users" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
